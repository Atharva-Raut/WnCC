The volatility of stock market is generally modeled by three techniques; namely Technical Analysis, Machine Learning algorithms & statistical analysis. These models help in developing optimal portfolio for best returns with minimum risk.

No. of mentees: 3


A hybrid Artificial Neural Network & Time series analysis based statistical approach has the potential to obtain robustness in the prediction. This will essentially make possible to predict the seasonal volatility in market as well as currency value prediction. 

With this project, efficacy of various techniques shall be benchmarked with plenty of daily stock market data.
