Description:

Journalists usually go out with their microphone to various places speaking into the recording device to note important events. They use these recordings later to prepare their article. 
We envision a system that can take a few minutes of audio from a recording device and use that information to write an article on that event. This fundamental concept can be extended to many other applications one of which can be automatic 
minutes-of-the-meet taker. 

We're looking for team members who have experience with programming. Experience with ML, more specifically speech recognition and NLP will be a plus. Some articles to begin with:
