Natural Language Processing which will  predict language (English , hindi , chinese and French)

<!--break-->

No. of mentees: 5

Description:

- Project will be based on Natural Language Processing which will  predict language (English , hindi , chinese and French)
- Predict the language of the written text and also language of the text from the images.
- Read text from images by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using tensorflow.
- Use concepts of natural language processing and deep learning to do this
- Will deploy the model on the heroku with the help of streamlit.
