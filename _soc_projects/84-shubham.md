Description:
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. A reinforcement learning agent is capable of learning on its own by exploring its environment to determine the best action to take in a certain situation. 

In this project, we'll build a snake game from scratch, and implement both basic Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to help the snake master the game and get really high scores. Check out this gif to see how the agent will get better as it keeps playing: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MnOe8JvfhyjQLZEXpKmxDtKR1B8MJKY7/view?usp=sharing 
If time permits, we'll also create an agent that learns to play the Flappy Bird game amazingly well. 

This project aims to introduce you to Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning, creating your own games, and good coding practices. No prior Machine Learning experience is expected, but it's a bonus if you know some stuff. Some familiarity with python and linear algebra is expected but you can catch up quickly without that too if you are motivated enough. 
Indicate your willingness to commit time to this project in the proposal as this project will have a steep learning curve and will be time-intensive. Be sure to mention previous (Python) coding or machine learning experience, if any."
